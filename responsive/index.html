                  <em>Many poems employ images of natural entities. I’m really interested in the use of classic natural imageries in Chinese traditional poetry. Specifically, the “moon” is my favorite natural imagery.</em>

                  <img class="moon" src="second.png" srcset="second@2x.png 2x" width="120" height="120" alt="Full Moon">
                  <img class="moon" src="third.png" srcset="third@2x.png 2x" width="120" height="120" alt="Half Moon">

               <p class="whole">The natural imageries could symbolize a person. In the Chinese poem JADE-STAIRCASE GRIEVANCE written by Li Bai, the moon symbolizes a disgraced and unloved concubine of a Chinese emperor. Since the poem’s opening establishes the important background of the poem, I would like to begin by analyzing the opening. “Night long on the jade staircase.” It implies that the situation happens in the imperial palace, which is the only place that is supposed to have jade staircases. The time is at nightfall. And only one person appears in this poem: “she.” Then, Li Bai employs the moon as natural imagery to symbolize the concubine. “She lets down crystalline blinds, gazes out through jewel lacework at the autumn moon.” She gazes out at the moon through the crystalline blinds after she lets it down. This is because the moon is the only thing that accompanies her in this lonely and long night. While nothing but the concubine accompanies the moon, nothing but the moon accompanies the concubine. The mutual pity between the concubine and the moon appears. The concubine does not want the moon to be alone, just as she does not want herself to be in a state of solitude and sorrow, so she gazes out at the moon through the blinds. Hence, the lonely moon essentially symbolizes the lonely concubine in this poem.</p>

               <p class="whole">The natural imageries could also indirectly convey the spiritual messages of the main character in the poem, which is usually the poet himself. For example, in the poem Amusing Myself, the poet Li Bai employs the moon in the stream as natural imagery to implicitly manifest and convey his spirit of broad-mindedness and optimism. To be specific, Li Bai wrote this poem when he was being demoted, which is supposed to be the most downhearted period of his life. Although the overall atmosphere of the poem is lonely, we could not find evidence of Li Bai’s decadence or depression in this poem. Instead, he extricated himself through interaction with the moon, which implicitly manifests his free and easy style of life. To be specific, as written by Li Bai, “Drunk, I rise and approach the moon in the stream.” After Li Bai gets drunk, instead of leaving himself in melancholy and  reflecting back on his experience of being demoted, he amused and extricated himself by trying to approach the moon in the stream. Hence, in short, with the aid of the moon as natural imagery, Li Bai essentially demonstrates his philosophical attitude about life and his spirit of broad-mindedness. In other words, the moon serves to indirectly convey Li Bai’s spiritual messages to the audiences.</p>
