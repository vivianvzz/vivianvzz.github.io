                  <em>In astrology, the moon is a symbol of the soul, and in the horoscope it determines the subject's capacity for reflection and adaptation. It also provides analogy for the stages of human development: the new moon is infancy, the crescent is youth and adolescence, the full moon is maturity and pregnancy, and the waning moon represents the decline of life, sleep.</em>

                  The moon is a feminine symbol, universally representing the rhythm of time as it embodies the cycle. The phases of the moon symbolize immortality and eternity, enlightenment or the dar k side of Nature herself. It might reflect inner knowledge, or the phases of man's condition on earth, since it controls the tides, the rains, the waters, and the seasons. It is the middle ground between the light of the sun and the darkness of night, and thus often represents the realm between the conscious and the unconscious.

                  There’s an element of mystery when we think about the moon and the stars. After all, the night is somewhat mysterious and we don’t know exactly what happens outside as we’re asleep. For the significant portion of humanity, though, the moon was an unexplored entity, even though it seemed relatively close to us. Interestingly, it was not until 1609 that human beings started to take a closer interest in the moon itself. It was Galileo Galilei who was one of the first luminaries to start exploring the moon closely. He was the first one to observe it with a telescope closely and discover it had valleys and mountains, just like planet Earth has.
